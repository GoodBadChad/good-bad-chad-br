/**
 * A Zone is a small portion of the Game World. 
 * The Game Engine will load and deal with one Zone at a time.
 * A Dimension (once an actual class, now simply an in-game concept) will contain several Zones.
 * Zones should not be created willy-nilly - the only way you should actually construct a Zone is from the static getZones() method!
 * 
 * A Zone will define the minimum (upper left) and maximum (bottom right) point which is going to be visible to the Camera -
 * anything outside this range will never be visible.
 * A Zone will also contain a load method: this ensures that all assets are downloaded, all entities are placed (INCLUDING CHAD), etc.

            (D)     Add as many zones to the playground as you want! Avoid adding temporary Zones to real Dimensions.
            (E)     Be sure that your load function is defined in the proper script, and that said script is imported into the head of index.html.
